This is the node server program. it is on a computer being moinitored.
The code running on this computer is writen in python so that is can be portable on any
machine whithout having the plugin developers having to write plugins for specific
operating systems and preventing us form having to write our own language to be compiled
on the remote computer. We will also have a headder file for creating plugins that will
contain functions to easily communicate with the root computer without much knolage of
how it works.
